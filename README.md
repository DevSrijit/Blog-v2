To get the most out of this blog, it would be helpful if you have some familiarity with basic HTML and JavaScript. This is a static site, which means the server builds it using the content of the `src` folder and serves it as plain HTML files for fast loading by your visitors. The posts are written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language that is easy to learn.
